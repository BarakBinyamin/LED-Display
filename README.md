This project demonstrates how to set up a five by five LED display


## Getting Started

This instructional will help guide you in making this project at home

### Prerequisites

- 25 5mm LED's
- some cardboard, wood, or any object that could hold 25 LED's. 
- an arduino microcontroller

In this project the container was laser cut out of wood, but cardboard would do just as well, the holes are about 5mm in diameter, spaced 5mm apart from eachother and the from the edges.


### Setup Steps

#### 1. Bend all 25 small leads down

#### 2. Bend all 25 big leads to the right
It's important they are all the same heigt and a good distance up from the LED, ensuring the horizontal and vertical leads won't touch

#### 3. Solder the rows
solder all the horizontal leads, row by row, it's important to avoid connected the horizontal and vertical leads

#### 4. Solder the columns
Solder all the vertical leads in each column, it's important to avoid connected the horizontal and vertical leads

## Deployment
- upload your sketch to the arduino
- connect the left-side leads of the Display to IO ports 1-5(or whichever ports you chose) on the arduino
- connect the bottom leads of the Display to IO ports 6-10 (or whichever ports you chose) on the the arduino
- power up the arduino
