This project demonstrates how to setup a five by five LED display


## Getting Started

This instructional will help guide you in making this project at home

### Prerequisites

- 25 5mm LED's
- some cardboard, wood, or any object that could hold 25 LED's
- an arduino microcontroller


### Setup Steps

#### 1. Bend all 25 small leads down

#### 2. Bend all 25 big leads to the right
it's important they are all the same heigt and a good distance up from the LED, ensuring that no horizontal and vertical leads will touch

## Deployment
- upload your sketch to the arduino
- connect the left-side leads of the Display to IO ports 1-5(or whichever ports you chose) on the arduino
- connect the bottom leads of the Display to IO ports 6-10 (or whichever ports you chose) on the the arduino
- power up the arduino
